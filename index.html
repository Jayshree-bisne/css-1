 <h2 class="h2">What is CSS?</h2>
 <ol class="list">
    <li>CSS Stands For Cascading Sheets.</li><br/>
    <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li><br/>

    <li><span class="para1">Css is not neccesary</span> <span class="para2">CSS is saves a lot of Work.</span><span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</span><br><br/>
        
    <li style="text-decoration:underline; font-style: italic;">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </li>
 </ol>

 <h3 class="h3">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>

    <ul class="para4" type="disc">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal -by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External -by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="para3">In this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it if yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    
 <p class="paral1"> When compairing CSS class vs ID, the different is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.
     ID, on the other hand , applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that  you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and its used by javaScript.</p>

     <p class="paral2"> In CSS, selector are used to target a specific elements or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
     
     <p class="paral3">There is a wide range od selectors available. Two od the most commonly used are class ID. Both Are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
